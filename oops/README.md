## Python Object Oriented programming

In this package, we will write some examples to understand the language constructs and
syntax suppored by python to wrote object oriented code.

We will explore the features and limitations on what can or can not be done
in python OOPs.

Learning OOPS concept is outside the scope of this. We assume that you are
already familiar with OOPS concept in any one programming language.
